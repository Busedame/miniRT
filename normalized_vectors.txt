1. Why do you want to represent directions without considering magnitude?

Representing directions without considering magnitude is useful because it allows you to focus solely on the direction an object is pointing or moving. 
This is important in scenarios like:
- Lighting in computer graphics: To calculate how light interacts with surfaces, you need the direction of light rays, not their intensity.
- Physics simulations: To determine the direction of forces or velocities without being affected by their strength.
- Navigation and orientation: To understand the direction of movement or orientation without considering speed or distance.
By normalizing vectors, you ensure that calculations involving directions are consistent and independent of the vector's original length.

2. Why is there an issue if it's not normalized?

If a vector is not normalized, calculations that depend on direction can be skewed by the vector's magnitude. For example, in lighting calculations,
an unnormalized vector can incorrectly affect the intensity of light on a surface.
Normalizing ensures that only the direction is considered, leading to accurate and consistent results.
