- The camera has a frustum that defines what it can see (a 3D pyramid-like shape).
- The near plane is the closest part of the frustum to the camera, and it's like a window through which the camera views the 3D world (until the far plane).
- The viewport is the 2D version of that window (the near plane) where the 3D world gets projected and displayed on the screen.

## Ray-Object Intersection

This section explains the mathematical approach to detecting intersections between rays and various geometric objects.

#### Ray Equation

A ray is represented as:

$$
P(t) = \text{ray-origin} + t \times \text{ray-dir}
$$

Where:
- **P(t):**  
    The point on the ray at distance \(t\) from the ray's origin.  
    It represents a location along the path defined by the ray, calculated by moving from the ray's starting point in the direction of the ray's direction vector.

- **ray-origin:**  
    The starting point of the ray, represented as a 3D vector.  
    This point marks the location where the ray begins its journey through space (camera).

- **ray-dir:**  
    The normalized direction vector of the ray.  
    A normalized vector has a magnitude (or length) of 1, ensuring that the scalar \(t\) directly corresponds to the distance traveled along the ray.  
    The direction vector defines the ray's path, indicating the direction in which the ray travels.

- **t:**  
    A scalar value indicating the distance along the ray.  
    It scales the direction vector, determining how far along the ray the point \( P(t) \) is. When the direction vector is normalized, the value of \( t \) directly represents the magnitude of the distance from the rayâ€™s origin.
